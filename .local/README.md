# .local directory
The purpose of this directory is to hold all the files that are either
generated (e.g.: shell history, vim editing info, ...) or cloned (e.g.: 
vim plugins, ...).

The files here are temporal or easily recreatable.

Other than this README no files in this directory are under version control.
